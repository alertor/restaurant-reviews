# Restaurant Reviews

This is a web + mobile app I am developing that will do restaurant reviews.  It uses an AWS AppSync GraphQL API on the backend to do the work.  The web application and mobile applications will be written using AWS Amplify libraries.

You can find the Backend deployment scripts within the `backend` directory.

## Deploying the Backend

```bash
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ npm run deploy
```

Ensure you have the Serverless Framework configured appropriately.
